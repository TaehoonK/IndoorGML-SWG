---+ Discussion and Decisions
   * Review on the last meeting
      * Question on the PD issue: The case explained at the github (<a href='https://github.com/opengeospatial/IndoorGML-SWG/issues/3%20' target='_blank'>https://github.com/opengeospatial/IndoorGML-SWG/issues/3</a>) by Abdou doesn't exactly reflect the indoor structure and may lead to confusions. Anyway, the decision is to<span style='background-color: transparent;'> keep PD but change the cardinality between </span> CellSpaceBoundary <span style='background-color: transparent;'> and Edge (at the side of </span> CellSpaceBoundary <span style='background-color: transparent;'> from 1..1 --&gt; 0..1)</span>
      * We need a guideline or manual in addition to the standard specification document as it is not very clear only with the standard document: such as use guide or implementation guide.
   * Implementation of IndoorGML 2.0
      * Scott clarified that we need at least three implementations as the[[https://docs.ogc.org/pol/05-020r27/05-020r27.html#two-track-standards-process-criteria][ P&P]] explains.
      * Possible implementations: FME (e.g. IndoorGML 1.1 -&gt; IndoorGML). ISPRS project (conversion from IFC to IndoorGML 2), and others such as Syrius. Dean will check the possibility of the implementation with FME and it looks not very difficult at this monent.
      * It may be useful to make a comparison table between 1.1 and 2.0
   * [[https://github.com/opengeospatial/IndoorGML-SWG/issues/4][Typographic Errors]] in IndoorGML 1.1 issued by Gobe
      * to include this agenda at the next meeting in Singapore and make a corrigendum
